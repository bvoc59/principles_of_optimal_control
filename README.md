# About 
This repository contains code examples and assignment  solutions for the MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) course 
[16.323: Principles of Optimal Control](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/16-323-principles-of-optimal-control-spring-2008/). Although the official language for this code is MATLAB, we use Python together with MATLAB-comparable libraries for scientific and numerical computing 
(`scipy`, `numpy`) and plotting (`matplotlib`). 
 
# Getting Started 

## Clone the Repository 

```
git clone ... op_control 
cd op_control 
```

## Install Dependencies 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

# Running Examples 
Examples are nothing more than Jupyter Notebooks. For instance, to launch the  `unconstrined_minimization.ipynb` example, run the following command: 

```
jupyter notebook examples/unconstrained_minimization.ipynb 
```
